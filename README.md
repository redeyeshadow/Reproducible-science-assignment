# Reproducible-science-assignment
This repository contains my answer to question 4 for the reproducible science coursework assignment. 
I have ran a linear regression model on the Palmer Penguins dataset and produced a scatterplot with the linear model overlayed.
In this repository I have included the raw and clean data in a directory called 'data'. The source code is in a directory called 'src'. The figures or output are in a directory called 'out', this includes my graph in the form for poster, powerpoint, report and svg.
